- Detailed JAMstack architecture and static site generation
- Cataloged ES2020+ JavaScript features and module system
- Documented Vitest unit testing framework
- Detailed Playwright end-to-end testing infrastructure
- Documented performance optimization strategies (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Cataloged CSS architecture and styling approaches
- Detailed development workflow and build processes
- Documented deployment optimization for static hosting

**Impact**:
- Complete technical reference for modern web application architecture
- Clear documentation of build pipeline and optimization strategies
- Foundation for testing infrastructure expansion
- Established baseline for performance monitoring

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Comprehensive Modern Web Stack Documentation

**Context**: Language learning application required complete documentation of Vite-based architecture and testing infrastructure

**Options Considered**:
1. **Basic Build Setup** - Pros: Quick reference Cons: Missing testing and optimization details
2. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Pros: Complete reference, detailed testing strategies Cons: Larger documentation effort

**Decision**: Full comprehensive documentation covering Vite, JAMstack, testing, and performance optimization

**Rationale**:
- Vite-based builds require clear documentation of tooling and plugins
- JAMstack architecture benefits from systematic explanation
- Testing infrastructure (Vitest + Playwright) needs clear setup documentation
- Performance optimization critical for user experience
- ES2020+ features require documentation for team consistency
- Static site deployment has specific optimization requirements

**Trade-offs**: Documentation effort (703 lines) but provides essential reference for modern web development
