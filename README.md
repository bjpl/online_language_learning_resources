## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Content-First**: Resources are the star, design supports discoverability
- **Thoughtful Typography**: Crimson Text for headlines, Inter for body text
- **Meaningful Color Palette**: Deep purple (wisdom), golden (achievement), teal (growth)
- **Organic Layouts**: Asymmetry and breathing room for a handcrafted feel
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations that feel intentional
